Plastic Classification App

## Project Description

The Plastic Classification App is a machine learning application that uses a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different types of plastic based on images. It can help identify plastic types such as HDPE, LDPE, PET, PP, PS, PVC, and others.

## Features

- Upload and classify plastic images.
- Real-time prediction using a trained CNN model.
- User-friendly Streamlit frontend.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras
- Streamlit
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
